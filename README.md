# migrate

Yet another abstract database migration toolkit for Node.js. Since it
is written with ES2017 and Flow awesomeness, it requires Node.js
\>= 7.6 (however, it may be transpiled down to ES5 with the ugly
RegeneratorRuntime bloat).

The API is a bit similar to [https://github.com/tj/node-migrate](node-migrate).

```sh
npm install --save @motet-a/migrate
```

# Documentation, tutorials, workshops and moocs

There is no fancy documentation, but donâ€™t worry, the source code
explains *exactly* what it does!
